I'm a software engineer at [insitro](https://www.insitro.com/) where I work on the microscopy
imaging platform. 

Previously, I was at Nir Yosef's lab at UC Berkeley where I worked as a research engineer
developing [scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org/), an open-source Python package used for deep
probabilistic analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data, among other projects.

Prior to this, I was briefly at Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED), where I got to
work with scientists to develop internal tools for searching and analyzing single-cell omics data.
Before that, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Bioengineering 
from UC Berkeley.
